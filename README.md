# Factors-influencing-performance-based-IADL
Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are complex everyday tasks essential for independent living. IADL impairments due to cognitive decline, rather than neuropsychiatric or physical factors, are key diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Although self- or informant-reported questionnaires are the most common IADL measure, they are inherently subjective, prone to biases and often influenced by non-cognitive factors. Performance-based assessments are a more objective alternative but can still be influenced, to a lesser extent, by non-cognitive factors. However, the exact magnitude of this influence remains unclear as no prior review has systematically examined the influence of non-cognitive factors on performance-based IADL measures. This review aimed to synthesise evidence on the cognitive and non-cognitive factors associated with performance-based IADL in older adults with normal cognition, MCI and dementia. Data were synthesised qualitatively, and 14 meta-analyses were conducted when sufficient consistency across studies allowed for pooling. Here you will find the datasets and code used to conduct these meta-analyses.
